## Exercises

When exercises have a solution later in the text,
this should be indicated by a parenthetical statement such as.

> Find the sum of integers from 1 to n (solved in chapter 3).

Exercises may be solved in footnotes.

## Links

When linking off to a page with more information, a footnote should be provided giving a brief explanation of the link.
This does not apply when the link directly matches the text and the connection is obvious.
For example, the name of a school or person's wikipedia page can usually be linked to directly.

## Story

Each chapter should begin with an engaging story or opinion.

## Code

Each chapter should have links to completed code files at the bottom.
The code follows Alex's style including:

- two space indent
- snake case (STL naming)
- { on same line as statement

## References to literature

Titles of books and articles are referred to with quotes: "The Art of Computer Programming"

## Headings

Only the first word of a heading should be capitalized.

## Alex foontones

Occassionally Alex will make comments which are interesting but not related
to the lesson or directly applicable to the audience.
These can be moved to footnotes, but should be indicated 
in the following manner:

    > Alex: here is a quote.

No quotation marks are used.

## Quotes 

Alex will sometimes use a voice as another person or group of people talking.
For example:

    You might say: "Who are you to tell us?"

Quotation marks should be used in these cases.


## References

When Alex references a piece of literature, individual, or event, we should find sources to support it.

## Footnotes

Footnotes can be added for any of the following reasons:

- explain more about the material
- connect it to another subject or topic
- provide additional examples
- Provide supporting references.
